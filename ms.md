# Introduction

The practice of science is becoming increasingly reliant on software --- despite
the lack of formal training [@wils14], upwards of 30% of scientists need to
*develop* their own. In ecology and evolution, this resulted in several journals
(notably *Methods in Ecology & Evolution*, *Ecography*, *BMC Ecology*) creating
specific sections for papers describing software package. This can only be
viewed as a good thing, since the call to publish software in an open way has
been made several times [@barn10], and is broadly viewed as a way towards
greater reproducibility [@ince12]. In addition, by providing a peer-reviewed,
journal approved venue, this change in editorial practices gives credit to
scientists for whom software development is a frequent research output.

Nevertheless, these papers are at best only pointers to the code, which is not
tracked in a bibliometrically measurable way. Some initiatives, such as
`impactstory.org`'s metrics for code re-use, are a good start, but for code to
be valued as a first-class research output, wider adoption of existing
technologies are needed.

Most concerning is the fact that, despite the recognized need for quality
control [@baxt06], we do not currently have a set of community-wide best
practices for how code should be released. While it is clear that code is
perceived as a research output just like data and papers, understanding *how* it
should be released, vetted, and tracked is still the great unknown. In a survey,
@jopp13 reported "troubling trends" in the use of software: only 30% of
ecologists using species distribution modeling software justified they use by
comparison with other tools, or previously published methods. My impression as a
reviewer, and reader of the literature, is that software use tends to follow a
trends, whereby if a package is picked up by a few authors, it will rapidly gain
traction regardless of its actual *quality*.

One of the recommendations by @jopp13 is that code should be reviewed. Yet as
almost anyone that wrote or attempted to review scientific software will attest,
this implies a tremendous effort. First, not all software are written in the
same language. This simple fact make looking for reviewers with the expertise to
handle a paper incredibly difficult. In an already over-burdened peer-review
system, restricting the search for referees to only people with the technical
know-how to perform code review is sure to make the delays increase. Second,
there are evidences that, even for the most trivial pieces of software,
experienced code-reviewers are not able to follow all possible paths of program
flow [@uwan06]; and it can easily be argued that very few ecologists are
*experienced* code reviewers --- nor should they be.

In order to make scientific software better, which is to say, to increase the
confidence of users, and make the act of producing it recognized in the same way
that writing papers is, these two challenges must be addressed. The good thing
is that solution are *already* in place, and all that is needed is to increase
their adoption by a broader share of the community.

# Proposed best practices

In the following sections, I will outline how a few steps can be used to make
software safer, easier to re-use, and discoverable. These are not meant to be
the end-all solution to software related issues, but rather to stimulate a
discussion between software producers, software users, and journal editors.

## Use continuous integration

Continuous integration [@duva07] is the practice of committing every change to a
source code to a service that will test whether or not the software still works.
This is usually done by coupling a continuous integration (CI) engine (such as,
*e.g.*, `travis-ci.org`) to a version control system such as `git` or SVN
[@ram13]. When a new change is "pushed", the CI engine will run a user-specified
series of steps, and if none on them fail, will report that the build (the
latest version of the code) is "passing". If not, the build will be "failing".

This serves as a first obvious step to evaluate the robustness of a code.
Requesting that code submitted for publication, as part of a software paper or
otherwise, have a "passing" status would make sense. Note also that most CI
engines allow to test the software on several platforms, or versions of *e.g.*,
`R`, `python`, etc, and therefore can be used to ensure that the code will be
available to users with various configurations.

## Use automated testing, and report the results

One of the most interesting uses of CI engines is to use them conjointly with a
robust *test suite*. A test suite is a series of situations that test how the
code responds to known inputs. For example, if one were to write a function to
measure the mean of a series of number, a good test suite would ensure that the
mean of $3.0$ and $4.0$ is $3.5$. An excellent test suite would ensure that the
mean of $3.0$ and the character `"a"` is not defined, and sends a message to the
user explaining what went wrong. Designing good test suites is somewhat of an
art form, but @hunt99 have a good description of how it can be done.

Most CI engines offer the possibility to run the tests, and subsequently report
how much of the code has been tested. For example, `coveralls.io` has a good
interface to see which files, functions, lines are not covered, and whether the
coverage changed over time. @yong03 gives good evidence that code coverage
analysis improves software quality.

From a publishing and reviewing point of view, coverage analysis is an
incredibly powerful tool. While reviewing the entirety of a source code is
difficult and not foolproof, it is much easier to look up what fraction of the
code is covered (services like `coveralls.io` go as far as color-coding the page
when the code is not properly covered), then to evaluate whether the test suite
is exhaustive enough. Focusing the reviewing effort on the test suite also has
the advantage of not requiring the reviewer to be familiar with the language the
code is written in, since test packages usually use a simple syntax. For
example, `python`'s `assertEqual(mean(2, 3), 2.5)`, `julia`'s `@test mean(2, 3)
2.5`, and `R`'s `expect_equal(mean(2, 3), 2.5)` are all easy to understand, even
if the details of how `mean` is implemented are not.

## Release code in a citeable way

As mentioned in the introduction, while software papers include links to the
code, the code itself is not tracked, and is difficultly citeable. This should
not be the case. The `zenodo.org` service recently partnered with *GitHub*, to
offer researchers the opportunity to get DOI (Digital Object Identifiers) for
their code. Every time a new *release* of the code is created, it receives a new
DOI, and can be cited as any other scientific document. This is a necessary step
if we want to fully understand the impact of code on the scientific literature.

More importantly, this is a major leap forward for reproducibility. If a
specific version of the code is used, and can be cited, it becomes possible to
reproduce the analysis in the exact same conditions --- this is particularly
true since *Zenodo* (hosted on the CERN Data Centre) offers independent and
redundant copies of every published version.

## Write documentation, publish use-cases

Looking at recently published software papers in any journal, it is clear that
there is no consensus on how these should be written; which is not necessarily a
bad thing, but suggests that the community is trying to find its marks in this
new practice. To some extent, software papers are a form of documentation. Yet,
using them to document *how the program works*, as opposed to *what the program
does*, feels like a missed opportunity. Most modern languages offer the
possibility to extract formatted "docstrings" to compile a manual from the code
itself. The `readthedocs.org` service does it automatically for `python`, and
there are solution for `R` (`roxygenize`), `julia` (`Docile.jl`), and others
languages. Since the "technical manual" can be extracted directly from the code,
software papers are the place to showcase what the software can do. For example,
the description of the `taxize` package for `R` [@cham13a], rather than giving a
run down of the different functions, emphasizes how the package can be used for
actual research questions, and links to the more extensive documentation.

# Conclusion

The use of most of the tools mentioned (a summary of which is given in Table 1)
can easily be made public. The `shields.io` service, for example, provides
templates that can be copied/pasted into any web page, giving an up-to-date
status information of CI builds, code coverage, link to the documentation, and
DOI of the current release. With most journals moving to online-only, it would
not be unreasonable to suggest that these, or similar, badges, be presented on
the online version of the paper. This would give *readers* the insurance that
the software they are going to read about has been tested, and is most likely to
be robust than software about which nothing is known. While this can currently
be done on the webpage of the project (see Figure 1), moving this information on
the paper itself would send a strong signal that using these tools is actively
encouraged.

If anything, the importance of code and software in day-to-day scientific
practice will only increase, and this is a good thing. It is only important to
remember that software is written by people, and people make mistake. Taking
simple precautions to make sure that the software works will undoubtedly
accelerate the review process, and increase the overall quality of code. In
parallel, adding unique identifiers on code, and focusing in describing what it
does rather than how it does it, will make it easier to find, easier to cite,
and easier to adopt.
